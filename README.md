Thermostat
==========
This is a solution to Makers Academy's [Thermostat Challenge](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/thermostat/0_challenge_map.md).

This uses an API to source the current weather from [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org).
It also uses [jQuery](https://jquery.com).

## Installation
Clone the repository and change into the directory:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:Andrew47/thermostat_javascript.git
$ cd thermostat_javascript
```

## Usage

Open index.html. You should see the following:
